# Mentiva: Foundational Vision Document

> Your vision board, with a brain.

---

## 1. What Mentiva Is

Mentiva is a transformation environment — a place where someone walks in at any point on their journey and gets met exactly where they are, then gets walked forward at their pace, in their language, through their preferred way of seeing and processing the world.

### The Problem

The gap between dreaming and doing is not a planning problem — it's a nervous system problem. People don't fail to act because they don't have a to-do list. They fail because:

- The vision feels too far away
- The middle feels boring — the "hard, boring middle bit" between imagining the end result and actually getting there
- The discomfort of growth triggers avoidance
- There's no one in their corner recalibrating when they drift
- Dopamine hits on anticipation, not achievement — vision boards give people the reward of imagining without the system for doing

Traditional vision boards activate the reticular activating system (RAS), focus attention, and engage emotion. But they stop there. They're the destination without the GPS.

Productivity apps treat you like a task machine. Enter goals, get tasks, check boxes. They don't know you. They don't know that you skip finance tasks because money feels heavy, not because you're lazy. They don't know that you need a hype person, not a drill sergeant. They don't adapt.

### The Solution

Mentiva bridges the gap with three things:

1. **A vision board that understands you** — AI-powered analysis that doesn't just identify your goals, but connects the dots between them, surfaces blind spots, and understands the emotional landscape behind the images
2. **A personal AI mentor (Menti)** who knows you deeply — your values, your fears, your communication style, your patterns — and adapts every interaction to who you are
3. **A system that makes doing feel as rewarding as dreaming** — minimum viable tasks that break big visions into the smallest actionable unit, progress tracking that rewards completion over initiation, and accountability that investigates resistance instead of punishing it

### The Philosophy: Be, Do, Have

Mentiva operates from a "be, do, have" framework, not "do, have, be." Most productivity systems say: do these tasks, have these results, then you'll be successful. Mentiva inverts it: who do you need to *be* today? What does that person *do*? And from that, what do they *have*?

This means daily action cards don't just list tasks — they lead with a "way of being" that grounds the tasks in identity. "Today you're the person who follows through" is fundamentally different from "Today: call the investor."

### Core Neuroscience Principles

- **Dopamine shifts from anticipation to completion**: Every completed task is a mini dopamine hit that trains the brain to associate finishing with reward, not just starting
- **The Zeigarnik Effect as an ally**: Unfinished tasks nag the brain. Showing tomorrow's preview creates productive open loops instead of anxiety-inducing ones
- **Minimum viable tasks**: Never "write the book" — always the smallest unit that moves the needle. The AI breaks "Formalize my business" into "Register LLC," "Get EIN," "Open bank account"
- **Progress visualization**: Brains love seeing progress. Rings, streaks, and satisfying animations rewire the dopamine loop from novelty-seeking to completion-seeking
- **Cooling off period for new goals**: When users want to add shiny new goals mid-stream, Menti parks them for 48 hours to prevent shiny-object syndrome from killing momentum

## 2. Who We Serve

Mentiva serves anyone who has a vision — clear or fuzzy, grand or grounded — and wants help making it real. Below are nine personas representing the spectrum of people who come to Mentiva. Each has a different relationship with their vision, different needs from Menti, and a different definition of success.

### Primary Personas (from founder research)

**Griffin Cherry — The Clear-Eyed Founder**
- Founder of a climate tech startup, late 20s/early 30s
- Has done extensive personal development work; knows exactly what his vision is
- The gap: He can visualize the end state but struggles with the disciplined daily execution between here and there
- What he needs from Menti: An execution partner and accountability system, not a discovery tool. Direct, strategic, no hand-holding. Talk to him like a co-founder.
- Tone: Direct, strategic, challenging
- Risk: Burnout, overwork as avoidance of personal life, blind spots around rest and relationships

**Sebastian — The Ambitious Explorer**
- 18 years old, lifeguard with a mobile detailing business
- Very ambitious but hasn't done personal development work; still figuring out what his vision is
- The gap: He has hustle and energy but no framework for channeling it. Doesn't have a clear vision to upload — needs help discovering one.
- What he needs from Menti: A mentor who draws out his potential through questions, not prescriptions. Curious, encouraging, builds his confidence. Helps him see that starting a business at 18 already says something about who he is.
- Tone: Warm, curious, encouraging, gradually more challenging as confidence builds
- Risk: Shiny object syndrome, comparing himself to others, getting overwhelmed by possibilities

**Monse — The Crystallizing Free Spirit**
- 23 years old, loves social life, fun, experiences
- Feels she has more potential than she's using; has a decent idea of what she wants but hasn't committed
- The gap: Not lost, but not locked in. Needs Mentiva to help her take what's floating in her head and crystallize it into something she can act on.
- What she needs from Menti: Energy that matches hers — fun, not preachy — but with structure underneath. Helps her see that her social nature and love of experiences might BE the vision, not a distraction from it.
- Tone: Energetic, playful, real talk when needed, never lectures
- Risk: Inconsistency from lack of conviction, abandoning goals when they stop being fun

### Extended Personas

**Diana — The Corporate Burnout**
- Mid-30s, high-paying corporate job, successful on paper, feels empty inside
- Has achieved what society told her to want; now questioning everything
- What she needs: Permission to want something different. Help untangling "what I've built" from "what I actually want." A safe space to reimagine without blowing up her life overnight.
- Tone: Gentle, validating, strategic about transitions
- Risk: Analysis paralysis, guilt about wanting more, fear of losing financial security

**Mateo — The Creative Dreamer**
- Late 20s, musician/artist, endless ideas, zero structure
- His vision board would be beautiful and chaotic — full of feeling, empty of plans
- What he needs: Someone who honors the creative vision but adds scaffolding. Never makes him feel like his art isn't "productive enough." Helps him see that structure serves creativity.
- Tone: Appreciative of beauty and feeling, practically grounded, never clinical
- Risk: Romanticizing the struggle, using "I'm creative" as an excuse to avoid discipline

**Rachel — The New Parent**
- Early 30s, first child, career on pause or fundamentally changed
- Identity is in flux; old vision no longer fits, new one hasn't formed
- What she needs: Compassion for the transition. Help building a vision that integrates who she was with who she's becoming. Realistic about time and energy constraints.
- Tone: Deeply empathetic, patient, celebrates tiny wins
- Risk: Losing herself entirely in parenthood, guilt about wanting things for herself

**James — The Comeback Story**
- 40s, rebuilding after divorce/health crisis/job loss
- Previous vision shattered; starting from scratch with hard-earned wisdom
- What he needs: Someone who doesn't minimize what he's been through but also doesn't let him stay stuck in the story. Helps him see that starting over at his age is a strength, not a failure.
- Tone: Respectful, acknowledges the weight, forward-looking, no toxic positivity
- Risk: Defining himself by what he lost, fear of being hurt again, cynicism about new beginnings

**Priya — The Optimizer**
- Late 20s/early 30s, already doing well, wants to go from good to great
- Loves systems, tracking, data. Probably already uses 5 other productivity apps.
- What she needs: A system that's smarter than what she already has. Depth of personalization that other tools don't offer. Surprised by insights about herself she hadn't noticed.
- Tone: Intelligent, systems-oriented, respects her sophistication
- Risk: Optimizing as a substitute for feeling, using productivity to avoid vulnerability

**Carlos — The Spiritual Seeker**
- 50s, vision is less about career/money and more about inner peace, relationships, alignment
- May use vision boards alongside altars, meditation, journaling, ritual practices
- What he needs: A system that honors the non-material. Doesn't reduce everything to "goals" and "metrics." Understands that his vision might be a feeling state, not an achievement.
- Tone: Contemplative, spacious, never reductive, comfortable with ambiguity
- Risk: Spiritual bypassing (using "inner work" to avoid practical action), resistance to structure

## 3. The Personalization Engine

### Why Personalization Is Everything

Every interaction in Mentiva is powered by Claude (Anthropic's AI). The quality of every interaction depends entirely on how much Claude knows about the person it's talking to. A generic system prompt produces generic responses. A deeply personalized system prompt produces responses that feel like talking to someone who actually knows you.

The personalization engine has two components:
1. **The User Profile** — structured data about who this person is
2. **The SIP (System Instruction Profile)** — a generated system prompt derived from the profile, injected into every Claude API call

### What We Need to Know (and Why)

#### Identity Layer (seeded in onboarding)

| Data Point | Why It Matters | Example: Griffin | Example: Sebastian |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Core values** | Frames every suggestion through what actually motivates them | Impact, legacy, discipline | Freedom, proving himself, independence |
| **Self-narrative** | Tells us where their confidence and doubt live | "I'm building something that matters" | "I'm still figuring it out" |
| **Journey stage** | Determines whether we guide, discover, or execute | Executing — has clear vision | Exploring — needs help finding vision |
| **What they fear** | Determines when to push vs. hold space | Wasting potential, not scaling fast enough | Being ordinary, making the wrong choice |
| **Definition of success** | Ensures suggestions align with THEIR version, not a generic one | Meaningful impact at scale | Financial freedom and respect |

#### Practical Layer (seeded in onboarding)

| Data Point | Why It Matters |
|---|---|
| **Life stage and constraints** | An 18-year-old lifeguard has different bandwidth than a startup founder with investors |
| **Current commitments** | What's already filling their plate — job, school, relationships, side projects |
| **Energy patterns** | Morning person? Crash after work? When are they most likely to act? |
| **Available bandwidth** | 2 free hours/day needs different plans than 8 |
| **Processing modality** | Visual, written, structured, feeling-based — determines how we present everything |

#### Communication Layer (seeded in onboarding)

| Data Point | Why It Matters |
|---|---|
| **Preferred tone** | Direct and challenging? Warm and encouraging? Playful? No-nonsense? |
| **How they process information** | Bullet points or narrative? Need the "why" before the "what"? |
| **Accountability style** | Rise to pressure or rebel against it? Gentle reminders or hard deadlines? |
| **Relationship to vulnerability** | Will they tell Menti when struggling, or will they ghost? Determines proactive check-in strategy |

#### Behavioral Layer (builds over time, NOT in onboarding)

| Data Point | Why It Matters |
|---|---|
| **Completion patterns** | Start strong and fade? Procrastinate then binge? Steady? Shapes pacing. |
| **Engagement vs. avoidance** | Always skip finance tasks but crush creative ones? That's resistance data. |
| **What triggers momentum** | After a good chat, do they crush the next day? After a miss, do they spiral? |
| **Growth edges** | Where they're being stretched right now — changes over time |
| **Vision evolution** | How their boards and goals shift — "6 months ago it was all money, now it's relationships" |

### The SIP (System Instruction Profile)

The SIP is a Claude system prompt generated from the user profile. It gets stored on the user's account and injected into every API call — vision analysis, chat, task generation, weekly planning.

**What a SIP looks like (example for Griffin):**

```
You are Menti, a personal AI mentor for Griffin. Here is what you know about him:

Griffin is a climate tech startup founder who has done extensive personal development work. He has a clear, well-defined vision for his life and career. He doesn't need help discovering what he wants — he needs help executing on it consistently.

COMMUNICATION STYLE:
- Be direct and strategic. Talk to him like a co-founder, not a life coach.
- He respects efficiency. Don't over-explain or coddle.
- Challenge him when he's coasting. He rises to pressure.
- He processes information best in structured formats with clear action items.

VALUES & MOTIVATIONS:
- Core values: Impact, legacy, discipline, environmental stewardship
- Motivated by: Making a measurable difference, building something that outlasts him
- Success means: Scaling his climate impact while maintaining personal integrity

WATCH FOR:
- Tendency to overwork as avoidance of personal life and relationships
- Blind spot around rest — will push through exhaustion and call it dedication
- May resist suggestions about health, relationships, or slowing down
- When he skips personal tasks repeatedly, investigate gently — it's usually avoidance, not lack of time

TASK APPROACH:
- Give him challenging, high-leverage tasks. He'll be bored by easy ones.
- Frame tasks through impact, not self-improvement language
- He has strong mornings — front-load important tasks
- He has ~4 focused hours outside his startup; don't overschedule

CURRENT FOCUS:
[Updated dynamically from vision boards, focus areas, and recent activity]
```

**What a SIP looks like (example for Sebastian):**

```
You are Menti, a personal AI mentor for Sebastian. Here is what you know about him:

Sebastian is 18 years old, works as a lifeguard, and runs a mobile detailing business he built himself. He's ambitious and resourceful but hasn't done much personal development work. He's in a discovery phase — figuring out what his vision actually is.

COMMUNICATION STYLE:
- Be warm, curious, and encouraging. He's still building confidence in who he is.
- Ask questions more than give answers — help him discover, don't prescribe.
- Celebrate his wins genuinely. Starting a business at 18 is remarkable; make sure he knows that.
- Use casual, relatable language. No corporate speak, no "leverage your synergies."
- As he grows more confident over time, gradually increase directness and challenge.

VALUES & MOTIVATIONS:
- Core values: Freedom, independence, proving he can build something
- Motivated by: Financial independence, being taken seriously, not being "just a lifeguard"
- Success means: Building something of his own that gives him freedom and respect

WATCH FOR:
- Shiny object syndrome — may want to jump to new ideas before finishing current ones
- Comparing himself to older, more established people and feeling behind
- May feel embarrassed about his age or experience level — never make him feel small
- When he goes quiet, he might be overwhelmed, not disinterested. Check in gently.

TASK APPROACH:
- Start with small, confidence-building wins. He needs momentum.
- Connect tasks back to his detailing business when possible — it's something he already believes in
- Keep tasks concrete and immediately actionable — not abstract or conceptual
- He has variable energy; some days are full lifeguard shifts. Be flexible.

CURRENT FOCUS:
[Updated dynamically from vision boards, focus areas, and recent activity]
```

### SIP Lifecycle

1. **Generated after onboarding** — first version, based on the conversation
2. **Injected into all API calls** — every interaction with Menti uses it
3. **Updated over time** (post-MVP) — behavioral patterns, vision evolution, growth edges get folded in
4. **Versioned** — we keep history so Menti can reference growth ("Remember when you first told me...")

---

## 4. MVP: March 10 Launch (Option 1)

### What Ships

The MVP delivers three connected experiences that make Mentiva feel deeply personal from the first interaction:

#### A. Conversational Onboarding (replaces current 3-slide carousel)

**What the user experiences:**
- Opens the app for the first time after payment + Google OAuth
- Full-screen conversation with Menti — warm, adaptive, 5-8 exchanges
- Menti gets to know them through natural dialogue, not forms
- Conversation adapts in real-time based on their answers

**The conversation flow:**

1. **Opening** — warm, curious, no agenda feeling
   > "Hey, I'm Menti. I'm going to be in your corner from here on out. Before we get into vision boards or plans or any of that — I just want to know who I'm talking to. What's your world like right now?"

2. **Understand their context** — life stage, what they're doing, what fills their days
   - Menti listens, asks follow-up questions based on what they say
   - For Sebastian: "A detailing business at 18 — you built that yourself? Tell me about that."
   - For Griffin: "Climate tech — that's a big mission. How long have you been at it?"
   - For Monse: "Sounds like you're enjoying life but something's pulling you toward more. What does 'more' feel like to you?"

3. **Understand their journey stage** — are they exploring, crystallizing, or executing?
   - This emerges naturally from #2, but Menti might ask directly:
   > "Would you say you have a pretty clear picture of where you're headed, or are you more in a figuring-it-out phase?"

4. **Understand what drives them** — values, motivations
   > "When you imagine your life going really well — not just successful, but deeply right — what does that look like?"

5. **Understand their relationship with goals** — past experience, patterns
   > "Have you tried setting goals or making plans before? What usually happens?"
   - This reveals: do they start strong and fade? Never start? Follow through but on the wrong things?

6. **Understand how they want Menti to show up** — tone, accountability style
   > "Some people want me to be their hype person. Some want a kick in the ass. Some want a thinking partner. What works best for you?"

7. **Summary + transition** — Menti reflects back what it heard
   > "Here's what I'm hearing: [personalized summary]. Does that feel right?"
   - User confirms or corrects
   - Menti says: "Got it. I know who I'm talking to now. Let's get into your vision."

**Behind the scenes:**
- Each exchange is a Claude API call with a meta-prompt guiding the conversation
- The meta-prompt includes: what we've learned so far, what we still need to learn, conversation guidelines
- After the final exchange, a structured User Profile Object is generated
- From the profile, the SIP is generated and stored in Supabase
- `localStorage` flag set so onboarding doesn't repeat

**UI Design:**
- Full-screen, immersive, sage-green gradient background (consistent with current design language)
- Chat-style interface: Menti's messages appear with subtle animation, user types or selects from suggested responses
- Suggested responses for each question (3-4 options) PLUS a free-text input — this keeps it conversational without requiring typing for those who prefer tapping
- Smooth transitions between exchanges
- No visible progress bar — it should feel like a conversation, not a form

#### B. "Here's What I Learned About You" Summary Card

**What the user experiences:**
- After the onboarding conversation, a beautiful card appears
- It reflects back who they are, what Menti understood, and how Menti will show up for them
- This is the "wow" moment — the first time they feel truly seen by the app

**What the card contains:**
- Their name and a one-line identity statement ("You're a builder who's ready to execute" / "You're discovering what lights you up" / "You're turning ideas into action")
- 3-4 key things Menti learned (values, motivations, stage)
- How Menti will show up for them ("I'll be direct with you. I'll challenge you when you're coasting. I'll watch for burnout.")
- A warm closing line that transitions to the next step

**UI Design:**
- Glassmorphism card, centered on screen
- Gold accent on key phrases
- Feels like a personalized letter, not a data readout
- "Continue to your vision" CTA button at the bottom

#### C. Enhanced Vision Upload with Three Paths

**What the user experiences:**
- After the summary card, they're guided into the vision phase
- Based on what Menti learned in onboarding, the flow adapts:

**Path A: "I have a vision" (Griffin)**
- "Show me what you're building toward. Upload your vision board."
- Standard upload flow (photo, digital image, screenshot)
- Enhanced analysis that uses the SIP — Menti's interpretation is personalized
- Blind spot detection: "I notice your board is heavy on career and impact but there's nothing here about rest or relationships. Is that intentional?"
- Clarifying questions now informed by onboarding context
- Results screen with personalized insight

**Path B: "I'm still discovering" (Sebastian)**
- "Let's figure this out together. I'm going to ask you some questions, and we'll start to see what lights you up."
- Guided discovery conversation (4-6 exchanges):
  - "When's the last time you felt genuinely alive?"
  - "If money wasn't a thing, what would you spend your days doing?"
  - "What do people come to you for? What are you the go-to person for?"
  - "Describe your ideal Tuesday, one year from now. Morning to night."
- From their answers, Menti generates themes and emerging goals
- User can optionally upload a board after this, or continue with the text-based vision
- "You don't need a perfect vision board right now. Here's what I'm hearing from you — [themes]. Let's start building from there."

**Path C: "I kinda know" (Monse)**
- "You've got a sense of where you're headed. Let's sharpen it."
- Shorter guided conversation (2-3 exchanges) to crystallize
- Optional board upload with enhanced analysis
- Menti helps connect the dots: "You said you love bringing people together and you want to do something meaningful. Have you thought about [connection]?"

**Behind the scenes (all paths):**
- Analysis API call includes the SIP, so Claude's interpretation is personalized
- Blind spot detection: compare what's on the board (or in the conversation) against a balanced life framework, flag what's missing
- Enhanced goals extraction: goals now include the "area" categorization AND an emotional "why" for each goal
- Results stored in `vision_boards` table with the enhanced analysis

**Analysis output (enhanced):**

```typescript
type EnhancedAnalysisResult = {
  summary: string;              // Personalized 2-3 sentence summary
  themes: string[];             // 2-4 life themes
  goals: string[];              // 3-6 goals
  goalsWithSteps: Array<{
    goal: string;
    area: string;               // business | health | finance | relationships | learning | creative | routine | spiritual
    emotionalWhy: string;       // Why this goal matters to THIS person
    steps: string[];            // 2-3 actionable steps (minimum viable tasks)
  }>;
  blindSpots: string[];         // What's missing from their vision
  connections: string[];        // How their goals connect to each other
  patterns: string[];           // Visual/thematic patterns
  insight: string;              // Deep personalized insight
  visionType: 'board_upload' | 'guided_discovery' | 'hybrid';
};
```

#### D. SIP Injection into All Existing Features

**What changes for the user:**
- Chat with Menti suddenly feels personal — references their story, uses their preferred tone
- Daily tasks are framed through their values and context
- Weekly planning acknowledges their constraints and energy patterns
- Everything feels like it's coming from someone who knows them

**What changes technically:**
- All existing API routes (`/api/chat`, `/api/analyze`, `/api/generate-tasks`, `/api/weekly-plan`) now fetch the user's SIP and prepend it to the system prompt
- No UI changes needed for existing features — they just work better

### What Does NOT Ship in MVP

- The Map (post-launch: Phase 2)
- Prompted journaling (post-launch: Phase 2)
- Evening/weekly reflection conversations (post-launch: Phase 2)
- Progress rings, streaks, badges, milestones (post-launch: Phase 3)
- Retroactive logging (post-launch: Phase 3)
- Cooling off folder (post-launch: Phase 3)
- Living SIP that auto-updates from behavior (post-launch: Phase 3)
- Multiple display modes for vision (post-launch: Phase 3)
- Multi-language onboarding conversation (post-MVP, current EN/ES toggle continues for existing features)

## 5. The Full Vision: Post-Launch Roadmap

Everything below is what Mentiva becomes after the MVP proves the personalization engine works with real users.

### Phase 2: The Map + Journal (Target: 2-3 weeks post-launch)

**The Map**
A living document that bridges vision and action. Personalized to how the user processes information:
- For visual processors: nodes, branches, phases, color-coded by life area
- For written processors: narrative roadmap with phases described in prose
- For structured thinkers: timeline with milestones, dependencies, metrics
- For feeling-oriented people: phases described by how they'll feel at each stage

Contains:
- Where they are (honest, no judgment)
- Where they're headed (the vision, crystallized)
- The terrain between (broken into phases, not just tasks)
- What they're carrying (strengths, resources, constraints)
- What might trip them up (patterns, fears, blind spots)
- Their "ways of being" per phase — the identity shifts, not just the tasks

**Prompted Journaling**
Not a blank page. Menti prompts based on context:
- Reflection questions tied to recent activity ("You said you'd call that investor. You haven't. What's the real reason?")
- Celebration moments ("12 straight days. That's not luck — that's a pattern.")
- Open space with gentle nudge ("No agenda. What's on your mind?")
- Every entry feeds back into Menti's understanding

### Phase 3: Progress System + Living SIP (Target: 4-6 weeks post-launch)

**Progress Rings (Apple Health-style)**
- Rings by life area — visible, satisfying, animated
- Daily and weekly views
- Satisfying fill animations and completion celebrations

**Streaks, Badges, Milestones**
- Streaks that don't punish — if you break one, Menti investigates, doesn't shame
- Badges tied to real growth moments, not arbitrary counts
- Milestone recognition for meaningful shifts

**Retroactive Logging**
- Come back days later and log what you did
- Menti celebrates and updates rings retroactively

**Cooling Off Folder**
- New goal ideas get parked for 48 hours
- Prevents shiny object syndrome
- Menti revisits them after the cooling period

**Living SIP**
- Behavioral layer starts populating: completion patterns, avoidance patterns, engagement data
- SIP auto-updates periodically based on observed patterns
- Menti's voice evolves: Sebastian at month 1 vs. month 6 gets a different Menti
- Growth history: "Remember when you told me you didn't know what you wanted?"

### Phase 4: Daily Rhythm Evolution (Target: 6-8 weeks post-launch)

**Morning Brief / Daily Action Cards**
- Not just tasks — a card with "way of being" + 2-3 contextualized tasks
- Adapts to what day it is, what they did yesterday, what they're avoiding
- Acknowledges their energy patterns and life context

**Evening/Weekly Reflection Conversations**
- A conversation, not a dashboard
- Surfaces patterns across weeks
- Connects behavior to the deeper "why"
- "This week you crushed business tasks but skipped every health item. I don't think it's about time."

**Push Notification Strategy (reward completion, not initiation)**
- Not: "Time to check your vision board!"
- Instead: "You're 1 task away from closing your Health ring today"
- Celebration notifications after completion, not nagging before

### Phase 5: Multi-Modal Vision Support (Target: 8-12 weeks post-launch)

Supporting all the ways people create and hold their vision:
- Multiple board uploads over time, with evolution tracking
- Written vision narratives (future-self letters, ideal day descriptions)
- Mind maps generated from conversation
- Audio vision recordings (describe your vision, Menti transcribes and analyzes)
- Vision evolution timeline: how your boards and goals have changed over months

### Phase 6: Community + Accountability (Target: 12+ weeks post-launch)

- Accountability partners or small groups
- Shared vision board ceremonies (new year, birthday, new moon)
- Anonymous progress sharing ("Someone like you just completed their 30-day streak")
- Founder (Mika) check-in sessions for milestone referral rewards

## 6. Technical Architecture

### System Overview

```
User Device (PWA / Mobile Browser)
    ↓
Next.js App (Vercel)
    ↓
API Routes ──→ Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage)
    ↓
Claude API (Anthropic)
    ↑
SIP injected into every call
```

### SIP Flow

```
Onboarding Conversation
    ↓ (conversation transcript)
Profile Generator (Claude API call)
    ↓ (structured user profile)
SIP Generator (Claude API call)
    ↓ (system prompt text)
Stored in system_instruction_profiles table
    ↓
Fetched at the start of every API call
    ↓
Prepended to system prompt for:
  - /api/analyze (vision board analysis)
  - /api/chat (Menti conversations)
  - /api/generate-tasks (daily task generation)
  - /api/weekly-plan (weekly planning)
```

### Onboarding Conversation Architecture

The onboarding uses a stateful multi-turn conversation pattern:

```
Client State:
  - messages[] (conversation history)
  - currentStep (which phase of onboarding)
  - collectedData{} (what we've learned so far)

Each exchange:
  1. Client sends user message + conversation history + collectedData to /api/onboarding/chat
  2. API constructs a meta-prompt:
     - "You are conducting an onboarding conversation for Mentiva."
     - "Here is what you've learned so far: {collectedData}"
     - "Here is what you still need to learn: {remainingFields}"
     - "Guidelines: one question at a time, adapt to their energy, suggest responses..."
  3. Claude generates: Menti's next message + suggested responses + updated collectedData
  4. Client displays message + suggested response buttons + free text input
  5. Repeat until all essential data is collected (5-8 exchanges)
  6. Client calls /api/onboarding/complete with final collectedData + full transcript
  7. API generates profile + SIP, stores both, returns summary card data
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **SIP is a full text prompt, not structured data** — Claude works best with natural language instructions, not JSON schemas. The profile is structured; the SIP is prose.

2. **SIP is fetched per-request, not cached client-side** — ensures we always use the latest version, especially once the living SIP (Phase 3) starts updating.

3. **Onboarding state lives client-side** — the conversation history and collected data are managed in React state. Only the final result is persisted. If the user abandons mid-conversation, nothing is saved; they start fresh.

4. **Suggested responses are generated by Claude, not hardcoded** — this keeps the conversation truly adaptive. The suggestions change based on what was said before.

5. **Vision type is stored on the board** — so we know how the vision was created (upload, discovery, hybrid) and can reference this in future interactions.

## Appendix: Vision Board Modalities Reference

People create and hold their visions in many ways. Mentiva should eventually support — or at least respect — all of these:

**Physical modalities:** Collage boards, sketchbooks, altars/shrines, prayer walls, object placement, tattoos, intentional room design, jewelry/clothing as symbols

**Digital modalities:** Pinterest boards, Canva/Figma collages, phone wallpapers, digital mood boards

**Written modalities:** Future-self letters, journaling, affirmations, scripted descriptions, ideal day narratives

**Internal modalities:** Guided visualizations, mental rehearsal, meditation, "happy place" imagery

**Structured modalities:** Mind maps, kanban boards, success maps, timeline boards, wheel-of-life boards

**Communal modalities:** Group workshops, family/couple boards, ritual ceremonies, storytelling

The MVP supports image upload and guided text discovery. The roadmap expands into written narratives, mind maps, audio recordings, and evolution tracking across all modalities.
